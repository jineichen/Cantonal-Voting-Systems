# Goal
This repository provides data and code to produce a map of electoral systems in place for parliamentary elections in Swiss cantons.

# Usage
The png-files represent the finished map of electoral rules. The map is available in both English and German.
Maps are generated by the quarto-markdown-file, which utilizes the data stored in the xlsx-database.
In addition, users must download a version of "swissboundaries" for the code to work (see: https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/landscape-model-swissboundaries3d)
